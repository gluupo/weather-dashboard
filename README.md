## objective
as a traveler, i want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that i can plan any trips accordingly.

## usage
- a weather dashboard that after searching for a city, gives you the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast
- upon a user search, you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- application shows the uv index and the background color changes to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- there is an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- data is stored in local storage so when you click a recent search you can recall it
